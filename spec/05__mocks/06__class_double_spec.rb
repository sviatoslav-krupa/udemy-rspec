# Notes:
#   * Class double is used to create a test double that is a stand-in for a class
#   * Class double is a type of verifying double
#   * The difference between instance and class doubles is that
#     instance doubles are used to create test doubles for instances of a class,
#     while class doubles are used to create test doubles for the class itself
#   * Class doubles can be used to stub or mock CLASS methods
#   * We can't stub non-existing methods
#   * `as_stubbed_const` is used to replace the class with the double during the test execution
