# Notes:
#   * Instance double is used to create a test double that is a stand-in for an instance of a class
#   * Instance double is a type of verifying double
#   * The difference between general double and instance double is that
#     the instance double only allows methods that are defined on the class to be called
#   * Instance doubles can be used to stub or mock INSTANCE methods
#   * We can't stub non-existing methods
#   * Instance double also keep tracking the number of arguments passed to the stubbed method

#     regular double
